# Spring_Boot_Basic_CRUD_With_Repo_Pattern

- A basic CRUD operation, there are 2 entities with one to many relations. 
- There are 3 services(repositories) and an implementation class for each one of these. 
- No fancy db work, it just uses two Lists to store information. 
### Major focuses: Making REST API, learning and applying standard approaches and conventions alongside wrong ones.
